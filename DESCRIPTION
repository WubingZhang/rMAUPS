Description: We developed a computational analysis pipeline Model-based Analysis of 
  the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System using R (rMAUPS), which performs computational analysis 
  of proteomics data efficiently and effectively. rMAUPS comprises four significant 
  modules, including quality control (QC), imputation, differential analysis, 
  and integrative analysis.
